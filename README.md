I'm a Process Engineering burning for innovative developments. I want to push the boundaries making the impossible possible. Therefore, I want to incorporate my engineering skills with machine learning. Enhanced methods are possibly created through superposition of robust, well known technics with recent machine learning algorithms and approaches.
